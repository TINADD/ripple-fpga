## Quick Start

The simplest way to build and run RippleFPGA is as follows.
~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/jordanpui/ripplefpga
$ cd ripplefpga
$ make mode=release_mt
$ cd bin
$ ./placer -aux toy_example/design.aux -out toy_example.out
~~~

## Building RippleFPGA

**Step 1:** Download the source codes. For example,
~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/jordanpui/ripplefpga
~~~

**Step 2:** Go to the project root and build by
~~~
$ cd ripplefpga
$ make mode=release_mt
~~~

Note that this will generate a folder `bin` under the root, which contains binaries and auxiliary files.
More details are in `Makefile`.

### Dependencies

* g++ (version 4.8.0) or other working c++ compliers
* Boost (version >= 1.58)

## Runing RippleFPGA

### Toy

Go to the `bin` directory and run binary `placer` with a toy design:
~~~
$ cd bin
$ ./placer -aux toy_example/design.aux -out toy_example.out
~~~

### Batch Test

Our placer is based on bookshelf format and was tested on two contest benchmarks [ISPD'16 Contest](http://www.ispd.cc/contests/16/) and [ISPD'17 Contest](http://www.ispd.cc/contests/17/), which can be downloaded via Dropbox ([ISPD16](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9c74a6f4o0rrd2t/AAA3V_fiP15pV20fV62apLoqa?dl=0), [ISPD17](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9aranna360wnez2/AABYc5n1Sak3AY3m25eJ7Nyka?dl=0)).
After download the benchmarks and place them under folder `BM_DIR`, you can use our script `run.sh`:
~~~
$ cd bin
$ export BENCHMARK_PATH=BM_DIR
$ ./run all
~~~
